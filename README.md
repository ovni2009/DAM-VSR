# DAM-VSR: Disentangling Appearance and Motion for Video Super-Resolution ðŸŽ¥âœ¨

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ovni2009/DAM-VSR.svg?style=flat-square&color=brightgreen)

Welcome to the DAM-VSR repository! This project focuses on the disentanglement of appearance and motion for enhancing video quality through super-resolution techniques. The aim is to provide a comprehensive framework that allows for the effective separation of motion and appearance in video sequences, leading to improved visual fidelity.

## Overview

Video super-resolution (VSR) is a crucial area in computer vision that aims to generate high-resolution video frames from low-resolution inputs. The DAM-VSR project introduces a novel approach to separate appearance and motion, allowing for more accurate reconstruction of video frames. This method not only enhances the visual quality but also preserves the dynamic characteristics of the video.

## Installation

To get started with DAM-VSR, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ovni2009/DAM-VSR.git
   cd DAM-VSR
   ```

2. Install the required packages. You can use `pip` to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the DAM-VSR model, you can use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input_path <path_to_low_res_video> --output_path <path_to_save_high_res_video>
```

Replace `<path_to_low_res_video>` with the path to your input video and `<path_to_save_high_res_video>` with the desired output path.

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Dataset

For training and evaluation, you can use publicly available datasets like:

- **VID**: A large-scale dataset for video understanding.
- **Vimeo-90K**: A dataset specifically designed for video super-resolution tasks.

You can download these datasets and place them in the `data` directory.

## Model Architecture

The DAM-VSR model consists of two main components:

1. **Appearance Module**: This module captures the static features of the video frames.
2. **Motion Module**: This module focuses on the dynamic aspects, extracting motion information.

The architecture is designed to work in tandem, allowing for effective disentanglement of appearance and motion.

## Training

To train the DAM-VSR model, you can use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --dataset <dataset_name> --epochs <number_of_epochs>
```

Replace `<dataset_name>` with the name of the dataset you are using and `<number_of_epochs>` with the desired number of training epochs.

### Hyperparameters

You can adjust various hyperparameters in the `config.py` file, such as learning rate, batch size, and more.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model, use the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --dataset <dataset_name>
```

Replace `<path_to_trained_model>` with the path to your trained model and `<dataset_name>` with the dataset you want to evaluate on.

## Results

The DAM-VSR model has shown promising results in various benchmarks. Below are some example outputs:
